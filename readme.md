## Problem SuiShare Solves

Do you often find yourself in situations where you need to split expenses with others, whether it's during trips with friends or sharing costs with business partners? SuiShare is here to make your life easier. Our project allows you to create groups, add participants, and track shared payments within those groups. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and security. You can always check the group's balance and settle debts with other participants. No more worrying about who owes what. 

## Challenges We Ran Into

Working with cutting-edge technologies can be challenging, especially when there's a lack of experienced resources and documentation. We faced difficulties, but our team found joy in overcoming these obstacles. One major challenge was calling MoveCall on an object. From a frontend perspective, it was impossible to receive error reports, making debugging quite inconvenient. We tackled this challenge by forming hypotheses and persistently experimenting. It would greatly benefit our project if the Sui npm package provided more informative error handling and reporting.
